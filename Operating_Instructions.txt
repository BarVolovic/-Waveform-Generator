1. Hardware Setup:
	a. Obtain the "design_1_wrapper.bit" file and "waveform_gen.c" source code for your project.
	b. Connect the Red Pitaya device to your computer using a suitable connection method (e.g., Ethernet, USB, etc.).
	c. Ensure that the Red Pitaya is powered on and properly connected to your computer.
	
2. File Transfer:
	a. Transfer the "design_1_wrapper.bit" and "waveform_gen.c" files to the Red Pitaya device. 
	   You can use any suitable file transfer method, such as SCP (Secure Copy), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), or a file-sharing service.
	b. Place both files in a convenient location on the Red Pitaya for easy access during the programming and compilation process.
	
3. Programming the Red Pitaya:
	a. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
	b. Use a command-line SSH (Secure Shell) tool to connect to the Red Pitaya device. For example: ssh username@redpitaya_ip_address.
	   We We recommend "MobaXterm".
	c. Navigate to the directory where the "design_1_wrapper.bit" file is located on the Red Pitaya.
	   Use the 'cd' command to change directories.
	d. Program the Red Pitaya with the "design_1_wrapper.bit" file by running the following command: "cat design_1_wrapper.bit > /dev/xdevcfg".
	e. Wait for the programming process to complete. This may take a few moments.
	
4. Compiling the Waveform Generator:
	a. While still connected to the Red Pitaya through the SSH session, navigate to the directory where the "waveform_gen.c" file is located. 
	   Use the 'cd' command if needed.
	b. Compile the "waveform_gen.c" source code using the following command: "gcc -g waveform_gen.c -o waveform_gen -lm".
	c. The compilation process may take a few moments. Once completed, you should have an executable named "waveform_gen" in the current directory.

5. Running the Waveform Generator:
	a. Enter the command ./waveform_gen to execute the compiled program.
	b. The waveform generator program should now be running, generating the desired waveforms as specified in the "waveform_gen.c" code.

6. Completion:
	a. Once you have finished using the waveform generator, you can exit the program by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt window.
	b. You can disconnect from the Red Pitaya by closing the SSH session or terminating the connection.
